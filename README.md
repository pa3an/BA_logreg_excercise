BA_logreg_excercise
logistic regression with a BA dataset

This is a small logistic regression project with a British Airways dataset
The aim is to predict ticket purchase using a number of independent variables
The project uses both logistic regression and random forest algorithm, with the former outperforming the latter
I also run the regression to obtain the coefficients of the single variables
Included is a correlation matrix to check for collinearity as well as
A couple of bar charts for the coefficients
Finally, I hot-encoded the dependent variable to run a linear regression test
(because I was not convinced by the coefficients)
While slightly better, the result was nothing to write home about

BA_logreg_excercise
logistic regression with a BA dataset

This is a small logistic regression project with a British Airways dataset.
The aim is to predict ticket purchase using a number of independent variables.
The project uses both logistic regression and random forest algorithm, with the former outperforming the latter.
I also run the regression to obtain the coefficients of the single variables.
Included is a correlation matrix to check for collinearity as well as
a couple of bar charts for the coefficients.
Finally, I hot-encoded the dependent variable to run a linear regression test
against the purchase_lead variable
(because I was not convinced by its coefficient, which is very close to 0).
While slightly improved, the result was nothing to write home about.
